  "summary": "The diff mounts YogaMorphBackground in the shared SiteLayout and adds CSS layering for site background/yoga layers/grain plus a reduced-motion-aware crossfade implementation. It also adds a dev-only asset diagnostic hook and a QA checklist. However, the diff does not provide evidence that the required static assets were added/verified in `frontend/public/assets/generated`, nor that the new diagnostic hook is actually invoked anywhere.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Ensure the yoga pose image assets and noise map exist under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and are correctly served (no 404s), adding missing files or correcting filenames as needed.",
      "reason": "The diff updates code to reference specific `/assets/generated/...` URLs and adds dev warnings, but there are no changes shown under `frontend/public/assets/generated` to prove the referenced images/noise map exist or were added/renamed to match these exact filenames.",

      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Prevent silent failures by validating asset availability during development/QA.",
      "reason": "A diagnostic hook (`useYogaBackgroundDiagnostics`) was added, but the diff summary does not show it being imported/used anywhere, so it may never run.",

      "id": "REQ-29",
      "requirement": "Add a quick regression QA pass focused on the background, including checking for no production-breaking console errors and verifying background/animation across navigation flows.",
      "reason": "A QA checklist doc is added, but the diff does not show any runnable QA automation or integration (only documentation). If the intent was purely a manual QA checklist, this is satisfied; if actual verification steps were expected in code/CI, there is no evidence.",
